# Javascript SDK, version 2.0.0

Version 2.0.0 is the latest version of the Javascript SDK. Use with care as it is not yet considered stable. You can
use [Bower](http://bower.io) for dependency management (e.g.
`bower install git:github.com/schibsted/sdk-js/releases/download/2.0.0/spid-sdk-2.0.0.zip` to install version `2.0.0`).

## Documentation

See the SPiD Tech docs, found elsewhere.

## Notes

All versions of the SDK will use a global variable/namespace&mdash;`SPiD.Talk.response`&mdash;when making JSONP calls.
This may change at a later date.

# Javascript SDK, version 1.7

Version 1.7 is now marked as stabile. This version use high performance session server on production.
This is only available on Norway at the time being, and will be up in Sweden shortly.
It also has support to use the Pulse version of the script, which collects user events.
Do not use Pulse version unless explicitly told so!

## Documentation & Install

## Notes

Currently blanketjs does not support mocha versions later than 1.12.1
