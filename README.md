# Javascript SDK, version 2.0.0

Version 2.0.0 is the latest version of the Javascript SDK. Use with care as it is not yet considered stable.

## Documentation

See the SPiD Tech docs, found elsewhere.

## Notes

All versions of the SDK will use a global variable/namespace&mdash;`SPiD.Talk.response`&mdash;when making JSONP calls.
This may change at a later date.
